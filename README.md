# Hello!

Inspiration
Most families do not know how much energy appliances like fridges or chargers use. A lot of power is wasted without anyone noticing, and bills go up. We thought—what if you could see exactly which devices are using the most electricity and get warned if something goes wrong?

What it does
Smart Energy Adapter helps you track how much electricity each device is using—live, on your phone or computer. If your TV or laptop starts using way too much power, or if something is about to break, you get an alert immediately. You can even turn things on or off remotely!

How we built it
We used a tiny computer (ESP32) with sensors that measure electricity for each plug. All the information goes to a dashboard we designed with cool graphics (like comets falling in the background!) so you can see every device’s stats easily. We made the controls big and simple so anyone can use them.

Challenges
Getting the sensors to show the right data and making alerts accurate was tough. We also wanted everything to look good and not be confusing, so designing the dashboard was a challenge.

What we’re proud of
We made electricity monitoring look awesome! You see every device’s power use clearly, and get warning messages and tips. It works on any screen and you can control it from anywhere.

What we learned
We learned how important it is to show graphs and send instant alerts. We also realized everyone likes it simple—just clear info and easy buttons!

What’s next
Next, we want to make a mobile app, send notifications right to your phone, and give smart advice on how to save even more energy at home!
